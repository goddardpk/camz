    <p>
      Cameras need to join a Camz Session. The administrator or person with the
      remote control must invite cameras to join the Camz camera session. Only
      cameras that have the Camz app installed and running will get an invite.
      Camz session can be in a state of active in inactive. Inactive sessions
      may need to re-establish permission to remote control cameras that
      previously were joined to a Camz session. Let's create a Camz session now!
